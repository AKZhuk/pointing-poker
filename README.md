<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
<!-- 
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://pastenow.ru/faf97fbdc001240956b86f1becefa610) -->
In the Scrum Agile framework, a sprint planning meeting is an event aimed at setting the product development goal and laying out a plan for the upcoming sprint based on a product backlog review by the team. Planning poker (or estimation poker) is a gamified method for estimating backlog items.
Each task is estimated by team members individually. Every team member picks a planning poker card with a estimate number. Initially, everyone's estimate is hidden from the others. This prompts everyone to think for themselves. When everybody's picked a card, every team member reveals their estimate.
